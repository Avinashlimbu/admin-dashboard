## Overview

The goal of this project was to practice CSS Grid by building a clean, 
organized dashboard layout including a sidebar, header, and main content area with projects, announcements, and trending sections.

## How I built this

- Started by setting up my Git repository and linking HTML and CSS files with some placeholder content to check everything was working smoothly.  
- Downloaded a full-resolution design reference to understand the overall layout and elements needed.  
- Created the basic structure in HTML for the sidebar, header, and main content containers.  
- Used CSS Grid extensively to build the main layout and then nested grids within the sidebar, header, and main content sections to position child elements precisely.  
- Added placeholder text and images to help visualize the layout and spacing.  
- Gathered icons (SVGs) and fonts from Material Design Icons and Google Fonts to style the dashboard.  
- Applied background colors and borders during development to better see the grid structure and alignment.

## What I learned

- How to effectively use CSS Grid to build complex layouts with nested grids.  
- Organizing HTML structure semantically for easier styling and maintainability.  
- Practical experience in positioning UI components like navigation menus, search bars, and content cards.  
- Managing assets such as icons and fonts to enhance the design.

## Notes

- This project isnâ€™t fully responsive but the grid layout can easily be adjusted for responsiveness in the future.  
- I focused on clean, readable code and keeping the layout simple and user-friendly.  
- Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
